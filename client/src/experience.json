            "description": "I worked as a DevOps Engineer intern at Avesha Systems as a part of the deployment and frontend testing teams. As a member of the deployment testing team, I utilized AWS and GCP tools to deploy Avesha's Kubeslice product and validate the deployment. As a member of the frontend testing team, I designed, documented, and implemented test suites written in Avesha's containerized testing framework. Avesha opened my eyes to the importance of keeping up with emerging technologies and the importance of open and clear communication amongst team members. I learned how to use software engineering tools such as Bitbucket and Jira, and learned how to uphold industry standards working as a contributor of a company-managed repository including PR etiquette and version control.

            "description": "I worked as a general employee at Staples in Plymouth, MA. My role changed each shift, but I spent time as a cashier, tech associate, sales associate, and general employee. As a tech associate, I assisted customers in their technical difficulties ranging from removing viruses to finding the right charging cable. I learned how to communicate with people who did not come from a tech background and how to ask the right series of questions to identify a problem and a solution. I maintained a clean, organized work environment to hand off to the next shift.",
