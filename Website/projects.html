                <h2>2 Player Snake</h2>
                <p>
                    I created a local 2 player version of the classic game "Snake" using Java in the Processing IDE. This project taught me the importance of keeping clean code, and allowed me to better understand the uses for object-oriented programming. I created a GUI from scratch, which allowed me to better understand what is going on behind the hood of a graphical interface. I had to think creatively about how to make something that I previously took for granted. This project gave me perspective on how to define and achieve goals, the importance of documentation, and the value of working on personal projects to improve or learn new skillsets.

                <h2>Socket Chess</h2>
                <p>
                    A partner and I created a peer-to-peer command-line chess game for our Network Programming course. The goal was to create a chess application in Python that would allow 2 players to play chess using a TCP protocol and a full-fledged GUI to go along with it. As we worked on the project, we realized that our aspirations may have been a little high, and shifted our focus to a terminal-based chess application. We used a UDP connection with python socket programming to send a move to the opposing player, who then had as long as they pleased to respond with a move of their own. We implemented a system that checked whether a given move was valid, and checked the state of the game for a winner after every move. Although the final product was rudimentary, this project taught me a lot about the coding process. I learned how to manage workload between 2 people, which allowed each of us to play to our own strengths to get the project done more efficiently. I also learned how important it is to manage time and stay focused on a goal; sometimes it may feel like the right time create images of the chess-pieces, but that time is better spent working on the functionality of the game. This project showed me the importance of communication, managing workload, and prioritizing tasks.
